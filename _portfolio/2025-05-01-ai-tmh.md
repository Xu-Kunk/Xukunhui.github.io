This research project is closely linked to my published work. We aimed to address the time-consuming and subjective nature of manual tear meniscus height (TMH) measurement in the diagnosis of dry eye disease.

### Project Description
This project involved developing an intelligent system using deep learning to automatically identify and measure TMH from corneal topography images (Keratograph 5M). The model was trained and validated on a large dataset from multiple medical centers, demonstrating high accuracy and robustness. It holds promise as an effective clinical tool for assisting in dry eye diagnosis.

### My Contributions
As a key member of the team, my primary responsibilities included:
*   **Data Preprocessing & Annotation:** Collaborated with the team to screen and standardize thousands of raw images. I used tools like ImageJ for precise annotation to create a high-quality dataset for model training.
*   **Multi-Center Validation:** Designed and executed the validation protocol, using independent datasets from different devices and centers to test the model's generalization capability and real-world performance.
*   **Result Analysis & Manuscript Preparation:** Participated in analyzing the model's performance metrics and contributed to writing the research findings into an academic paper.

### Tech Stack
*   **Programming Language:** Python
*   **Deep Learning Framework:** PyTorch
*   **Image Analysis & Processing:** ImageJ, Pandas
